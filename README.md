# Map-Generator-FdF
**Description:** This program takes a text file formatted in **ASCII** and transforms it into a file in ***FdF*** format. 

## Explanations of operation
- 📝 The user must have a text file in *UTF-8* format.
- 📦 The contents of this file must entirely be **ASCII** characters among these:
  - ```: . ~ * ^ 5 Y J ? 7 ! P G B & @ #``` and the space key.
- 💻 The compiled program must take the desired file as execution argument and the rendered file like this:
  - ```>./gen_fdf test_file.txt render.fdf```
- If the file is valid, you will have your file containing the formatted map.
##### *Good tests ;)*

## How to get its image in ASCII characters?
Several solutions are possible, such as coding an algorithm that does it for you! Or more simply use a website like this:
